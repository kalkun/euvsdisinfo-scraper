There is in fact a clear record of strong cooperation between the EU and Russia, dating back to 1994, when the two sides negotiated a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Russia was identified as a strategic partner for the EU, and was the only country with which the EU held summits not once, but twice a year.

The trade performance of the Republic of Moldova during the first two years of DCFTA implementation was negatively affected by several factors (with no relation to the Association Agreement signed with EU): 
continuous political instability in the Republic of Moldova, less favourable national/regional economic situation (banking crisis, theft of the billion, MDL devaluation, US dollar appreciation, unfavourable climatic conditions, decrease in the international prices for some products), regional geopolitical tensions (the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine). http://www.expert-grup.org/en/biblioteca/item/1409-evolutia-fluxurilor-comerciale-rm-ue-dupa-2-ani-de-implementare-a-zlsac/1409-evolutia-fluxurilor-comerciale-rm-ue-dupa-2-ani-de-implementare-a-zlsac"

The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was a reaction of large parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. The total number of members of radical groups, e.g. the ""Right Sector"", never amounted to more than a few hundred to a maximum of a thousand people. The vast majority of the protesters (up to two million at one time nationwide) consisted of peaceful Ukrainian citizens http://bit.ly/1Tl9X7W.
The EU strongly supported holding open, free and democratic Presidential and parliamentary elections in May and October 2014 and called on all parties to join in this support, to help overcome the crisis and allow the Ukrainian people to choose their own future. 
The 2014 presidential election in Ukraine was a genuine election largely in line with international commitments and respecting fundamental freedoms, despite the hostile security environment in two eastern regions of the country. According to the OSCE (of which Russia is a participating State) ""the people of Ukraine had the opportunity to genuinely express their will at the ballot box"" http://bit.ly/1hqcDuR.

Exports from Ukraine to the EU and Ukrainian imports from the EU both increased by about 25% in the first four months of 2017 compared to the same period the previous year.
The EU has pledged a €12.8 billion support package for the next few years to support the reform process. This includes €3.41 billion in loans as EU macro-financial assistance (MFA), of which €2.81 billion has already been provided. This is the largest amount of macro-financial assistance that the EU has disbursed to any non-EU country. On 24 November 2016, in Brussels, the European Commission Vice-President for Energy Union, Maroš Šefčovič and the Energy Minister of Ukraine, Ihor Nasalyk, signed a new Memorandum of Understanding on a Strategic Energy Partnership between the EU and Ukraine. The new Memorandum of Understanding aims to stimulate energy cooperation between the EU and Ukraine. The European Commission, in close cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank, continues to support the modernisation of the Ukrainian gas transportation system, in line with the Joint Declaration made in March 2009.
